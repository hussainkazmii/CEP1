Welcome to my first-ever repository, "Bank Account Management System"! This project represents my initial steps into programming and software development. It's a simple system for managing bank accounts, featuring account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.

Features:

Account Creation: Users can create bank accounts by providing their details.
Deposit and Withdrawal: Account holders can manage funds.
Balance Inquiry: Users can check their balances.
Error Handling: Basic error handling ensures smooth operation.
